# Simple Translatome Analysis Tool for Ribo-Seq (STATR) pipeline
Enviromental factors can have a huge impact on the condition of a cell. This condition may be reflected by the gene expression. Using Ribo-Seq this gene expression can be accuratly measured. Ribo-seq, also known as ribosome profiling, is a next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology, which can analyse the ribosome-protected mRNAs. Ribo-Seq has some major advantegous compared to similar techniques. In contrast to similar technique, Ribo-Seq analyses the messenger-RNA (mRNA) that is currently being translated on a ribosome. This provides a more accurate overview of the protein levels in a cell and can therefore be used to compare cells under different conditions.

In order to compare the Ribo-Seq data from different cells this pipeline was created. The pipeline can have multiple samples (with repeats) as input and creates the following outpus:
* Dendogram
* Heatmap
* Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

## Installation
The following installations need to be executed in order to use the pipeline:
### Snakemake
Snakemake can be installed by executing the following coomand:

`pip install snakemake`
### Trimmomatic
Open a terminal in the resources folder and execute the following commands:

`wget http://www.usadellab.org/cms/uploads/supplementary/Trimmomatic/Trimmomatic-0.39.zip`
`unzip Trimmomatic-0.39.zip`
### R packages
All of the R packages can be installed by executing the `InstallPacakges.R` script

## Usage
The pipeline can be used as follows:

`snakemake --snakefile {path to snakefile} --cores {amount of cores}`
